Categorical Analysis of Healthcare Sites Dataset:

Dataset used - https://healthdata.gov/ASPR/COVID-19-Treatments/xkzp-zhs7/about_data

In this section of the portfolio, I delve into a comprehensive categorical analysis of a healthcare sites dataset. The dataset comprises critical information about various healthcare providers, including their participation in Patient Assistance Programs (PAP), Telehealth capabilities, and other significant categorical features. Through this analysis, I aim to uncover valuable insights and trends within the dataset, shedding light on the distribution of key features that play a crucial role in the healthcare landscape.

The exploration involves calculating proportions and percentages for binary categorical columns, providing a clear understanding of the prevalence of specific programs or capabilities across the healthcare sites. By employing SQL queries, I aim to quantify the extent of participation in programs such as PAP and Telehealth, offering a quantitative perspective on their adoption within the dataset.

The findings from this categorical analysis not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dataset but also serve as a testament to my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, a fundamental skill for any aspiring data analyst.
